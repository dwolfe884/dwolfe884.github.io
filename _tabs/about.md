## Who am I?
Hello!
My name is ```David Wolfe``` and I'm a college student studying Cyber Security Engineering at Iowa State University (ISU). 

## Professional Experience
I've been working in info sec for the past 3 or so years as an intern for different companies. During this time I've gained professional experience working on embedded security with manditory access control (MAC) systems such as SELinux and AppArmor. As well as experience in consulting as a security tester responsible for performing penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, social engineering, etc. 

## Educational Experience
I'm currently working on completing my 4 year degree from ISU. At ISU I'm the Capture the Flag council member for the Information Assurance Student Group (IASG). In this role I spend my time organizing events and finding new competitions for our teams to compete in. On top of my studies at ISU I'm also pursuing an [Undergraduate Certificate in Applied Cybersecurity](https://www.sans.edu/academics/undergraduate) from the SANS Technology Institute. I was awarded a full scholarship from SANS to complete this program after my performance in the yearly [SANS Cyber Fasttrack](https://cyber-fasttrack.org/) CTF competition in 2019.
