## Description

This is probably the project I'm most proud of to date. I'm planning on adding more deatils to this post about the techniques I used to create this, but it was a lot of geometry and shader nodes. I learned so much about the different inputs and ways to manipulate objects through geometry nodes.

The end goal of this project was to have a looping, vaporwave wallpaper to use with wallpaper engine for me and my friends. I'm so happy with it I might add it to the community list for wallpaper engine, if I do I'll add a link here.

## Results

FYI: I need to figure out how to get good videos into this...
