## Description

This one was a lot of fun for me personally. I'm not sure anybody would look at these results and say they are `good`, but I can look at them and enjoy how silly they are. This was a great project to practice low poly sculpting, manual UV unwrapping, and some light rigging as a bonus! Now please, enjoy these silly renders of my digital cat (yes, he's [polydactyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyl_cat)).
