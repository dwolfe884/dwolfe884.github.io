## Description

What more is there to say. Nothing like following a [Blender Guru](https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru/videos) tutorial series in 2024. This really was the perfect introduction to Blender 4.0 and helped me get back up to speed. I decided to try and go a little above and beyond with a fancy cat shaped donut with some chocolate coin eyes. I love it, but some people have told me it looks very tired...
