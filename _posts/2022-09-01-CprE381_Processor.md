## Intro
This project was the most time consuming and effort intensive projects I undertook during my time at Iowa State University. The deliverable for this project was a 5 stage pipelined proceessor with hardware enforced data forwarding capabilities. This required our team to use everything we had learned about CPU design and more in order to finish on time.

## My Role
I became the team lead for my group and was responsible for delegating out tasks and bringing the different parts of the processor together. I also wrote a number of the more complex, larger scale components such as the control unit (CU) and the arithmatic logic unit (ALU). In order to manage version control and component integration I created a github repo to host our project. You can find our final project [here](https://github.com/dwolfe884/381processor)

## Challenges Faced
My team and I faced a number of challenges that slowed our progress to a crawl.

## Lessons Learned
CprE 381 will be the class I remember the most from my undergraduate degree program. It was the class that brough all of the different computing concepts I had leared up to this point together and made me realize what it takes to run a computer.
