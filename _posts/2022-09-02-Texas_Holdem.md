## Overview:
CprE 186 is the lesser know project based follow up to CprE 185. In this class students are broken up into teams and tasked with coming up with a small project to work on throughout the year. My team of 4 decided on making a simple Texas Hold'em game that could be hosted on a webserver. Being that we were all freshman, this project required an incredible amount of learning. These files can be found on my ["github"](https://github.com/dwolfe884/186Game).

## My Role
Coming into this project I had the most experience working with the web app framework Vue.js so I ended up being the team lead. I was responsible for not only developing significant parts of the application but also for delegating work to my fellow team members. I also helped to answer many common questions the team had while they were trying to get familiar with JavaScript and Vue.js in general.

## Lessons Learned
The biggest lesson I took away from this project was the important of starting from the same foundational knowledge. All 4 of our group members came into this project at vastly different skill levels and with different programming experience. I would have been able to save myself and our team a lot of time if I had just given a brief intro presentation about the basics of Vue.js to our entire team instead of doing it one on one with each team member over the course of a week of work.

## Resources Used
Most of the resources I used for this project were random stack overflow posts. However, for getting my team members up to date on Vue.js I turned to the official Vue.js ["documentation"](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html). These docs are incredibly detailed and provide lots of helpful examples and interactive tools. This was the most important resource for my team during our project.
