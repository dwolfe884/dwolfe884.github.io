## Overview:

This was a bit of a speed sculpt competition. My friend and I decided to see who could recreat the other in blender faster. This was done over an 2 or 3 hours on a random weeknight. I'm happy with the results and vibes this one gives off. It was also refreshing to do a cartoon character where I didn't have to worry about super accurate sculpting or details.

## Results
