## Description

This was my second real project after the classic donut tutorial! I've been seeing a lot of these isometric room designs on my social feeds so I figured I'd give it a try. My goal with this project was simple, make a cool isometric space that I would enjoy working and gaming in. I wasn't really working on any skills in particulal, mostly just getting aquainted with the new tools and layout of Blender 4.0.

### Results

The final render of the room is included below along with a small flip book of the renders I did each night when I was finished making changes.
