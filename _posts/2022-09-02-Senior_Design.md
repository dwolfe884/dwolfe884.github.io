## Description of project 
The senior design project I was assigned to work on was `CySecAgri`. The deliverable for this project was a user friendly web application that aggregated farming IoT sensor data, processed it into user friendly graphs and charts, and finally ran intrusion detection algorithims against it to detect if there was a threat actor or other issue facing the sensors or the crops they were monitoring.

## Your role 
Being one of the 3 cyber security engineering majors on this team I was tasked with ensuring our senor data was encrypted and trasmitted securly between our cloud storage and the finally users browser session. This data contained a number of different measurements that could be considered sensitive depending on the specific implementation of our application.

## Skills or knowledge gained 
In order to properly protect our data in transit I learned about many different attacks that could be possible against our applications data.

I also learned new techniques and common practices for ensuring data is stored securly in the cloud as I was responsible for the API key our basestation used for posting data to AWS.

## Link supporting documents 
In the first set of meetings with our client we decided it was important to create a closed loop system diagram to get a better idea of the exact scope of our project. This diagram and a number of other documents that ensured we acomplishe dour goals can be found on our shared [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zYstwKIJDPYnWsC2eBpmDFC3hkMTf6Nm?usp=sharing)

## Big picture contribution
I will list my features and specific stuff, maybe some screenshots, of all the cool stuff I do while working on this project.
