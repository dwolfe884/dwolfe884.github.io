## Description of project 
The senior design project I was assigned to work on was `CySecAgri`. The deliverable for this project was a user friendly web application that aggregated farming IoT sensor data, processed it into user friendly graphs and charts, and finally ran intrusion detection algorithims against it to detect if there was a threat actor or other issue facing the sensors or the crops they were monitoring.

## Your role 
Being one of the 3 cyber security engineering majors on this team I was tasked with ensuring our senor data was encrypted and trasmitted securly between our cloud storage and the finaly users browser session. This data contained a number of different measurements that could be considered sensitive depending on the specific implementation of our application.

## Skills or knowledge gained 
In order to properly protect our data in transit I learned about many different attacks that could be possible against our applications data.

## Link supporting documents 
We haven't done anything yet

## Big picture contribution
I will list my features and specific stuff, maybe some screenshots, of all the cool stuff I do while working on this project.
