## Description

This was my first small attempt at a character project. It was a really good first character project because of how simple Ice Bear is. No detailed sculpting, no weird proportions, just a rough outline and some texturing/shading work. Oh, I also took this as a chance to experiment with grease pencil, so I added a little cartoon outline that I think looks nice.
