## Description

After a successful gaming room project, I decided to go for the opposite aesthetic. Instead of dark, artificial, and isolated. I wanted to go for an open, organic, inviting room. I never ended up adding enough plants to the walls, but it was still a good chance to try out different techniques with curves and deform modifiers.
