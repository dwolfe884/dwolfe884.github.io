## Description

I was running low on inspiration when I decided to remake the most import part of my living space, my coffee bar! Biggest takeaway from this project was the utility of the boolean modifier when adding round objects to flat toplogy. This can be seen in the steam knob on the side of the espresso machine in the final render.
